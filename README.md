# My First React App!

The following App is a React JS front-end Program which begins with a form to prompt the user for their name.

If they submit their name they get a greeting with their name.

Then a list of items is displayed, following with a dropdown to filter the list based on the user's category selection.

Every time the user selects an option via the dropdown the item list gets re-rendered to display it accordingly.
